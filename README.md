The goal of this project was to track the memory of a dataframe in the pandas library in python. To make sure every node conforms to the rules of the sub-language, it is necessary to override each relevant visit node function that is part of the built in ast library in python. To track the memory of a dataframe, each integer is assigned a value of 2 bytes, and each recursive call to the child node increases the count by the size of the integer. In the end, the total memory size is calculated.
The class conforms() checks to see if the node follows the rules while infer_type() finds the memory usage.
